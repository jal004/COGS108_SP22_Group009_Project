    "The New York stock exchange, the largest and highly esteemed market in the world,  marks its origin back in the 18th century with the Buttonwood Agreement. [^1] This would formally create a system where trusted parties were able to buy and sell stock with security and serve the economy. Stock’s primary purpose in the economy is to provide companies with more capital, the government to collect taxes, and investors to make more money. Many factors can affect stock and its price; these are not limited to supply and demand, inflation, and economic strength. \n",
    "\n",
    "An economic factor that we want to analyze is inflation rate. Inflation rate is the rise in price of goods and services. In regards to its relationship with stock, higher inflation tends to lead to lower purchasing power and affects relationship between consumer and company, employer earnings and company capital. There is also an inverse relationship with unemployment rate and the economy, thus affecting the stock market negatively as well. A prime example is the Great Recession. As the employment rate increased drastically to 10% from 5%, stocks also fell by more than 50%. [^3]  However, the stock market relationship with the unemployment rate cannot be correlated since there is a history of economic expansion during high unemployment rate and high stock prices.\n",

    "A country’s Gross Domestic Product per capita (GDP) measures the economic output per person. The stock market can positively and negatively impact GDP. [^2]\n",
    "\n",
    "We decided to analyze inflation rate, GDP per capita, unemployment rate, and interest rate because of its large impact on the economy and as a result, the stock market as well. These factors are large indicators of a wealthy economy and how an economy is behaving at a certain time. Thus, we want to utilize these statistics from 1980 to 2016, a time period that contained large events in the economy such as the Great Recession. As we look into these factors prior to our data, we see that there is still no perfect formula to measure when the ideal time to purchase stocks are. This is why we are analyzing data on certain economic factors in order to view what relationships these factors have and discover, from the past, whether or not some economic variables influence the stock market greater than others. \n",

    "Our team hypothesizes that when the United States’ economy is doing well, the stock market will also be doing well, as measured by its high prices and low volatility — volatility being price movement. Essentially, we foresee the two as having similar positive and negative cycles. When a country’s economy is flourishing, consumers will feel good about buying and investing, particularly for purchases like stocks; however, when a country’s economy is withering, consumers will worry about the lowering value in their investments and sell their stocks. When that recession hits, both the economy and the stock market will be low. \n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, high GDP per capita, 2-5% inflation, low unemployment, and a lower interest rate will lead to growth, as measured by higher prices and lower volatility, in the New York Stock Exchange market. On the other hand, low GDP per capita, inflation above 10%, high unemployment, and a higher interest rate will lead to decline, as measured by lower prices and higher volatility, in the NYSE market. For one, we believe that rising stocks increase consumer confidence, which can lead to a higher GDP per capita since it is primarily driven by spending and investments, like buying into stocks. Then, we found that the Federal Reserve’s inflation target is 2% to ensure “maximum employment”, so our team decided that an inflation rate of 2-5% is good for the economy since more people are in employment, while anything above 10% is too much since it overly erodes the value of a dollar in earnings [^1] — essentially, low inflation might impact the stock market positively, whereas too much inflation will lead to greater volatile fluctuations in market prices. Similar to above, low unemployment may lead to a rise in stock price and stability given the positive status of the economy, while high unemployment may lead to a dip in stock price and stability given the negative status of the economy. And lastly, when the country's interest rate is too high, consumers have less disposable income for things like investments, which can equate to a less successful stock market. \n",

    "Our team sees no issues with privacy or terms of agreement because no personal information was used in this study. Only annual data on economic and stock trends for the United States were presented. That also leads to a lack of biases on our part since we are not focusing on populations of people or predicting outcomes for the future. This study was only executed out of curiosity to see the relationships between the American economy and NYSE stock market. However, we do realize that there may be the possibility for an outside individual to use our data to gather information to actually predict trends in the stock market. That becomes a possible ethical issue since the ability to predict stock market trends will most likely be used for inequitable gain and nefarious purposes, instead of being a free tool for everyone to use. This could become an unintended consequence of our project. "
